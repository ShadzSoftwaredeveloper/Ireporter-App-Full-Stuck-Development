# Backend Connection Complete ✅

## Overview
All context providers have been successfully refactored to connect to the backend API instead of using localStorage. The application now uses real authentication flow with data fetched from and stored in your MySQL database.

## What Was Changed

### 1. ✅ AuthContext (`/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
**Status: Already Connected** - This was already properly connected to the backend.

**Features:**
- User authentication via API (login/register)
- Token-based authentication stored in localStorage
- Profile management via API
- User management (admin only)
- All user data fetched from backend

### 2. ✅ DataContext (`/contexts/DataContext.tsx`)
**Status: NOW Connected** - Successfully refactored from localStorage to backend API.

**Changes Made:**
- **Fetch Incidents**: Now fetches from `GET /api/incidents` on mount
- **Create Incident**: Uses `POST /api/incidents` 
- **Update Incident**: Uses `PUT /api/incidents/:id`
- **Delete Incident**: Uses `DELETE /api/incidents/:id`
- All methods are now async and return Promises
- Automatically refetches when user logs in/out
- Maintains notification callbacks for admin notifications

**API Endpoints Used:**
```typescript
GET    /api/incidents           - Fetch all incidents
POST   /api/incidents           - Create new incident
PUT    /api/incidents/:id       - Update incident
DELETE /api/incidents/:id       - Delete incident
```

### 3. ✅ NotificationContext (`/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`)
**Status: NOW Connected** - Successfully refactored from localStorage to backend API.

**Changes Made:**
- **Fetch Notifications**: Now fetches from `GET /api/notifications` on mount
- **Add Notification**: Uses `POST /api/notifications`
- **Mark as Read**: Uses `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read`
- **Mark All as Read**: Uses `PATCH /api/notifications/mark-all-read`
- **Delete Notification**: Uses `DELETE /api/notifications/:id`
- All methods now make API calls
- Toast notifications still work for real-time feedback

**API Endpoints Used:**
```typescript
GET    /api/notifications                - Fetch user's notifications
POST   /api/notifications                - Create notification
PATCH  /api/notifications/:id/read       - Mark single as read
PATCH  /api/notifications/mark-all-read  - Mark all as read
DELETE /api/notifications/:id            - Delete notification
```

### 4. ✅ Updated Types (`/types/index.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Updated `DataContextType` to reflect async methods:
  - `createIncident`: Returns `Promise<void>`
  - `updateIncident`: Returns `Promise<void>`
  - `deleteIncident`: Returns `Promise<void>`

### 5. ✅ Updated Pages

All pages that use the DataContext methods have been updated to use `await` for async operations:

#### **CreateIncident.tsx**
- Now uses `await createIncident()` and `await updateIncident()`
- Proper error handling with try/catch
- Shows loading state during upload

#### **AdminDashboard.tsx**
- Now uses `await updateIncident()` and `await deleteIncident()`
- Added error handling with toast notifications
- Async functions for all data operations

#### **IncidentDetail.tsx**
- Now uses `await deleteIncident()` and `await updateIncident()`
- Proper error handling with user feedback
- Navigates after successful operations

#### **ViewIncidents.tsx**
- Now uses `await deleteIncident()`
- Error handling for delete operations
- User feedback via toast notifications

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/logs in via API
2. Backend returns JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage (only the token, not user data)
4. Token sent with every API request via `Authorization` header
5. Backend validates token and returns user data

### Data Flow
1. When app loads, AuthContext fetches current user from `/api/auth/profile`
2. Once user is loaded, DataContext fetches incidents from `/api/incidents`
3. NotificationContext fetches notifications from `/api/notifications`
4. All CRUD operations go through API endpoints
5. Local state updates after successful API responses

### API Configuration
All API endpoints are configured in `/config/api.ts`:
- Base URL from environment variable: `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5000`)
- All endpoints properly configured
- Auth headers automatically added to requests

## Environment Variables Required

### Frontend (.env in root)
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
```

### Backend (.env in backend folder)
```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=incident_reporting
DB_DIALECT=mysql

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Email (for notifications)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=your_email@gmail.com

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## Testing the Connection

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Authentication**
   - Register a new user
   - Login with credentials
   - Check browser console for API requests

4. **Test Incidents**
   - Create a new incident
   - View incidents list
   - Update incident status (as admin)
   - Delete incident

5. **Test Notifications**
   - Create incident as user (admin should receive notification)
   - Update status as admin (user should receive notification)
   - Mark notifications as read
   - Check email for notifications

## Key Benefits

✅ **Real Database Storage**: All data persists in MySQL database
✅ **Proper Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with token validation
✅ **Email Notifications**: Real email notifications for incident creation and status updates
✅ **Email Verification (optional)**: Email verification can be enabled if desired
✅ **Media Storage**: Images/videos stored in backend uploads folder with URLs in database
✅ **Role-Based Access**: Admin and user roles properly enforced
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Notifications and status changes reflected across sessions
